# Machine Learning Portfolio - Data Analytics & Algorithms
This repository contains my continuous assessment project for the MSc in Data Science - Data Analytics & Algorithms module. It includes implementations of various machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn datasets, preprocessing steps, and trained models.
## Project Details
This portfolio consists of Jupyter notebooks where I have explored and implemented different supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The models were trained using built-in datasets from scikit-learn, and various preprocessing techniques were applied before training.
## Implemented Algorithms
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* K-Means Clustering
## Workflow
Each notebook follows a structured workflow:

1. Dataset Loading - Used built-in datasets from sklearn.datasets
2. Data Preprocessing - Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables
3. Model Training - Training the models using sklearn's machine learning algorithms
4. Hyperparameter Tuning - Adjusting parameters to optimize performance
5. Performance Evaluation - Using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
6. Analysis & Insights - Understanding model behavior and improvements

## Future Improvements

* Implement models on custom datasets
* Tune hyperparameters for better performance
* Deploy a serialized version of the models as an application
* Compare different versions of algorithms and evaluate performance impact
